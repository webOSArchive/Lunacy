/*
 * Calendar items in a Sync request, made acceptable to an Exchange ActiveSync 16.x server
 * (Docs/outlook-eas.md).
 *
 * Palm's mojomail-eas writes a calendar item as EAS 12.1 had it. From 16.0 a server sets some
 * of its fields itself and refuses an item that carries them: Exchange Online answers such an
 * Add with status 6 (the item couldn't be converted), and nothing is stored (measured on the
 * Fold3, 2026-11-08: Palm's Add with UID, DtStamp and MeetingStatus refused). Where the version
 * adapter sends a request at 16.x, the request's calendar elements are rewritten:
 *
 * - DtStamp goes: the server stamps the item.
 * - UID becomes ClientUid (16.1) in an Add: the server makes the UID, and is told the
 *   client's. In a Change it goes: the item is the server's by then, named by its ServerId.
 * - OrganizerName and OrganizerEmail go: the organizer is the account.
 * - MeetingStatus goes: the server decides it from the attendees.
 * - Location, a string in 12.1, becomes AirSyncBase's Location with the string as its
 *   DisplayName (16.0 moved it there; the old element is refused).
 * - A Body's EstimatedDataSize goes: it is the server's to say, and a client's is refused.
 * - A Recurrence that doesn't say its first day of the week gets FirstDayOfWeek 0 (Sunday).
 * - An Exception's ExceptionStartTime becomes AirSyncBase's InstanceId, the same compact
 *   date (16.0 names the occurrence that way).
 *
 * - The TimeZone's two changes, as Palm writes them, are this year's instants broken down in
 *   UTC: Los Angeles changes "at 09:00 and 10:00", London "on the 4th Sunday of October" (the
 *   last Sunday in 2026). Windows' form (TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION) wants the local wall-clock time
 *   and the nth weekday, 5 for the last; Exchange keeps the zone as Palm sent it ("Customized
 *   Time Zone"), so a series would move an hour early in the wrong week. Each change is put
 *   back on this year's calendar and written as Windows writes it (calf_fix_tz). Only a zone
 *   with no names is Palm's own; one Exchange made, which Palm keeps and sends back, is left.
 *
 * Then calf_split: from 16.0 a client MUST NOT send Exceptions in a Sync request (MS-ASCAL,
 * Exceptions); an occurrence is changed by a Change of its own, naming the series by ServerId
 * and the occurrence by InstanceId, or deleted by such a Delete (MS-ASCMD, Change and Delete).
 * Palm's Change of a series carries its Exceptions (refused with status 6, measured on
 * Exchange Online 2026-11-08, whatever names the occurrence), so each Exception becomes such a
 * Change or Delete after the series' own, and the series' Change goes without them. At 16.x a
 * property a Change leaves out stays as it was (MS-ASCMD, Change), so an occurrence's Change
 * carries only what Palm wrote for it. An Add can't name its occurrences yet (it has no
 * ServerId): its Exceptions go, and the next Change of the series sends them.
 *
 * Every other byte stays as it was. Requests are whole in memory (CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS), so this
 * rewrites a buffer rather than a stream. Measured against Exchange Online on 2026-11-08: Palm's
 * Add refused with status 6; with UID, DtStamp and MeetingStatus rewritten, an event without a
 * location stored; one with a location still refused until Location moved. Pure logic, tested on the build machine
 * (tests/calfilter_test.c).
